# IBM Data Science - Best Practices

## Architecture

Architecture  - more specifically IT architecture - describes the components that together form the solution. 
It describes what these components do and how they interact with each other.
The architecture for a project is designed / developed by IT architect(s).
Since it's the blueprint for the solution it is crucial for all project members to have some level of understanding of the architecture - especially for technical roles.

> Architecture is a specification of static and dynamic behaviour of a system in a specific context.

In this chapter several reference architectures are shown. A reference architecture is a generic form of architecture, which contains the typical components but is not specific to an exact use case / project. As such they encapsulate well-working and established concepts.

> A reference architecture basically describes the best practices for a certain type of architecture problem.

IT architects use reference architectures as a basis for their project specific architecture and adjust it to the specific needs of the project.

### Application Architecture

The most common architectures you will see are application architectures, which describe the solution's blueprint **in production**.
It describes the final result once the solution is live and used by actual users; it doesn't describe how you get there.
Removing / Ignoring e.g. the development components reduces the level of complexity and keeps the architecture somewhat simple and understandable.

As an introduction into application architecture, we'll look at architectures for web application, since this is one of the most common types of applications. Other types e.g. mobile application usually have similar architecture but are much more complex.

#### 3-Tier Architecture

One of the most established reference architectures is the 3-tier architecture (sometimes also multi-tier architecture):
In this architecture the solution is divided in 3 distinctive layers / tiers.

- The **presentation layer** provides the user interface (UI).
It visualizes the website to the user and accepts their inputs (clicks, typed input, etc.).
Based on the user inputs it triggers the business logic on the business layer.
  - *Web shop example:*
  The website of the web shop is hosted on the presentation layer.
  If you click to add a product to your cart, then the website reaches out to the business layer

- On the **business layer** (or **application layer**) the business functionality is hosted and executed.
It provides interfaces for the presentation layer to trigger certain actions.
The business logic computes the answer and returns it to the presentation layer for visualization.
For some of the calculations the business logic may require some data, for which it will reach out to the data layer.
  - *Web shop example:*
  The business functionality to check if a certain product is in stock is hosted on the business layer.
  The business layer receives the desired product and quantity from the frontend.
  It will ask the data layer for the current in stock quantity and verify if sufficient quantity is in stock.
  It sends the result back to the presentation layer.

- The **data layer** manages the stored data. Its main job is to make the data accessible for business functionality and to maintain data consistency. It is important to note that there is usually no direct connection between the data layer and the presentation layer.
  - *Web shop example:* The data layer may be implemented by a small SQL database. When the business layer asks for the current in stock quantity, the database looks up the number and returns it to the business layer for computation.

In software design there is a similar pattern to this architecture called MVC pattern (model view controller pattern).
The model is comparable to the data layer, the view is comparable to the presentation layer and the controller comparable to the business layer.
The main difference is level where they are applied to:
MVC pattern is usually use on individual class level, e.g. a Python class.

On the left side of the image below you can see a example for the 3-tier architecture.
Note: Since the client browser is not under our control it is not counted as a separate layer.

</p>

#### Micro Services Architecture

Micro service is an application architectural style in which an application is composed of many discrete, network-connected components called 'micro services'.
Instead of splitting the application by technology (presentation, business logic or data), the application is split by different business functionality.
Each of these services offers an web interface, which can be use / consumed by other micro services. The different micro services are connected via network.

> *Web shop example:*
> Instead of having the in stock check stretched across tow layers, it is bundle with other inventory related functionality into a inventory micro service.
> This inventory micro service would then be used / consumed by a cart service, when the user tries to add a certain item to their cart.

Because of their smaller size micro services tend to be better scalable and are usually easier to [deploy on the cloud](./cloud_deployment.md#chapter-14---cloud-deployment).
This is why a lot of organizations have adopted them, however as always there is no 'one size fits all' for architecture.

On the right side of the image in the previous a simple example of a micro services architecture is shown.
The image below shows the IBM reference architecture of micro services.

  <sub>&copy; IBM - <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/microservices/reference-architecture/">Microservices reference architecture</a></sub>
</p>

> **Caution**<br/>
> Since every time one micro service calls another micro service a network request is created, having a huge number of very small micro services will cause a lot of network traffic and latency - basically making your application super slow.<br/>
> *Rule of thumb:* For comparison [Netflix has ~700 micro services](https://link.medium.com/nrVHoTubx2) for their whole solution. Compare your application's size to Netflix and then extrapolate your estimated amount of micro services.

One concept closely related to micro services is the '*twelve-factor app*'. It basically describes what to consider when building an app-as-a-service. This is very similar to a micro service, which is why (some of) its ideas are often re-used when developing micro services.

### AWS agnostic architecture machine learning pipeline

![Machine Learning Pipeline overview](./res/img/Machine_Learning_Pipeline_AWS.png)

#### CodeCommit

AWS CodeCommit replaces a conventional git repository - this is the essential place where all of the used code of a
project is stored. The repository will contain the following files as a basic structure:

- **CI/CD** Scripts for building and deploying code - these can be accessed and executed in CodeDeploy and CodeBuild.
- **docker** folder which contains the docker files, which are necessary to build the docker image containing the
    training code. This image will then be executed in AWS SageMaker for example.
- **src** folder contains the source files for training, inference and also tests.
- **build.py** file if you use pybuilder instead if CodeBuild to build a distributable python package.
- **environment.yml** to specify the required packages for a conda environment, which can be deployed anywhere.

#### CodeDeploy/CodeBuild

CodeBuild will run all unit and integration tests, as well as build a tarball from the specified python sources,
which can be deployed into a docker container later.
CodeDeploy will execute a specified deployment scenario, which will e.g. build the docker container, push it to a docker
image repository and in the end load the image in a production setting.

#### AWS ECR

AWS ECR functions as the repository for all docker containers, which are built in the above-mentioned pipeline.
It acts as repository for containers just as CodeCommit acts as a repository for config files and source code.
This is the point where AWS SageMaker will look for a specified docker image, when a training job is triggered with the respective parameters from the outside.

#### AWS SageMaker

AWS SageMaker acts as the runtime environment for all training jobs.
AWS SageMaker can be triggered via an API/python binding.
There a user specifies, what kind of model is to be run and where the respective input and output data is located.
AWS SageMaker will accept docker images with a predefined entry point containing the training code.
However, it is also possible run a TensorFlow/MXNext/ONNX-defined job there.
SageMaker offers a User Interface for administration and can be elastically scaled as it is a managed service.
Therefore, the user can choose from a wide variety of machines, which are used to train a specific model.
AWS SageMaker can also be used to perform Hyperparameter Tuning, which can be triggered via the API as well.
The tool will automatically select the best performing combination of hyperparameters.
The results from a run can be directly written to S3 or even DynamoDB.  

#### AWS S3

AWS S3 acts as the basic file system for input and output files. Usually S3 is used to store large training data files
and can also be used to store serialized models.
AWS S3 seamlessly integrates with SageMaker.

#### AWS DynamoDB

AWS DynamoDB is a key-value based NoSQL database, which is completely managed by AWS and can be scaled on demand.
The database can be used to hold the KPIs from a model run to track model performance over time for example.
It is also leveraged to integrate runtime information and performance meta data for a model run.
AWS DynamoDB can be seamlessly integrated with QuickSight, which is a data visualization tool offered by AWS.

#### AWS Elastic Inference

AWS Elastic Inference is an EC2 instance on steroids. Models trained in AWS SageMaker can be hosted on an EI instance for prediction. The underlying machine(s) can be scaled on demand.

### Open source architecture machine learning pipeline

![Machine Learning Pipeline overview](./res/img/Machine_Learning_Pipeline_OpenSource.png)

#### GIT

GIT acts as the main source of truth by representing the current code, infrastructure, tests and deployment plans.
The current infrastructure setup as well as code version should be visible in the repository.

#### Jenkins

Jenkins can be utilized as build server, which executed pre-defined scripts hosted on GIT.

#### Nexus

Nexus holds the code artifacts (e.g. Python eggs, Java Beans) in all published versions.
Also the built container images are hosted here to be retrieved by the processing engine.

#### Kubernetes/Docker host

There is a large variety of potential tech stacks for this part.
For hosting a training session different levels of complexity can be introduced (from low to high):

- Docker host: A simple docker host can run container, which contains the training (or any other) code. Multiple hosts can be managed
and scaled by introducing Hashicorp's Nomad for orchestration.
- Kubernetes cluster: Deployment, orchestration, scaling, registry etc. can be implemented by leveraging a Kubernetes cluster.
The cluster can run on any hardware and host training (or any other) code containers. Kubernetes supports the whole
lifecycle of the specific container.
- Kubeflow: The Google driven open source project aims at a scalable Machine Learning pipeline running on a Kubernetes cluster.
Kubeflow offers the possibility to create machine learning flows containing mutual dependencies and parameters.
It will automatically execute steps of a pre defined pipeline (data prep before training) and schedule containers automatically.
Kubeflow can also be hosted on a GCP environment.

#### Data Sources

Data sources can be anything from CSV to raw text files, SQL or NOSQL databases etc.

#### MongoDB

As a simple JSON object store with support for a large variety of queries (aggregation pipelines for analyses) MongoDB can act as a KPI and metadata store for tracking the results from training runs.
MongoDB is not specifically optimized for Big Data workloads and is therefore a good analytics base layer hosting data for high level dashboards.

#### minio/OpenIO

minio and OpenIO are basic object stores, which can be extended by the AWS S3 API for interaction.
These stores can be used to host the physical model files, as well as training data or other metadata not relevant for further analytics in dashboards.

#### Container + Flask/Falcon

To host a model built in the machine learning pipeline as an endpoint, a RESTful API can be offered to other consuming services.
This complies with a micro service architecture setup. A simple RESTful API can be implemented using the Falcon or Flask API for Python.

### C3 agnostic architecture machine learning pipeline

![Machine Learning Pipeline overview](./res/img/Machine_Learning_Pipeline_C3.png)

For GIT and Jenkins see [Open source architecture ML pipeline](https://github.ibm.com/datascience-ibm/data-science-best-practices/blob/master/architecture.md#open-source-architecture-machine-learning-pipeline)

#### C3 AI Suite

C3 AI Suite is a closed system that covers most of the pipeline internally.
It includes dedicated data stores, e.g. SQL DB, object storage, wide-column storage.
It also brings its own compute /execution environment.
Only for versioning and building / automation separate tools are used.

> *Programming Languages:*
> C3 AI Suite uses 3 programming languages:
> C3's custom C3-Types, JavaScript and Python.
> The data model is coded in C3-Types which is only compatible with the C3 AI Suite.
> Methods can be implemented either in Python or JavaScript.
> For consistency we recommend deciding on 1 of them per project.
> For testing JavaScript's Jasmine framework is used.
> Therefore, all tests have to be written in JavaScript.
> It is necessary for developers to be able to program in all 3 languages.
>
> *Environments:*
> Methods and tests cannot be run on a local environment, therefore dedicated C3 AI Suite environment(s) are required for development.
>
> *Data Versioning:*
> Because C3 AI Suite manages the data completely internally, data versioning might be challenging to achieve since it has to be done locally separate from the C3 environment.

For more details on the C3 AI Suite, we recommend the [C3 AI Education Program](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/c3-ai-education-program) (IBM Internal)
