The goal of this document is to enable you as a data scientist to develop a data science use case in a semi-professional setting to make it ready for production use. This means focusing on the versioning, scalability, monitoring and engineering of the solution.

### Prerequisites

#### Required Skills

- Python programming - Intermediate Level
- Data Science - Intermediate Level
- Shell, Terminal or CMD (command-line) - Beginner Level
- Git - Beginner Level

#### Tools

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python 3.7
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - Our recommendations: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

> **Q: Can I use Jupyter Notebooks as my IDE?**<br/>
> A: No, since this is not an IDE. Also we feel that it tends to encourage bad coding practice, especially with beginners.
> For further details: [I don't like Notebooks - Joel Grus (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U)

> **Q: Can I use a plain text editor?**<br/>
> A: Yes, if you feel that this is the best for you, then go for it.
> Just make sure that it is a plain text editor and not a rich-text editor.

> **Q: Can I use Anaconda?**<br/>
> A: No, Anaconda Free Version is only permitted for 'individual hobbyists, academics, non-profits, and small businesses' ([more details](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/anaconda-commercial-edition-faq)); You require commercial licensing to use Anaconda in a large enterprise.

'IBM Services for AI at Scale' is a GBS offering, which aims at scaling current AI engagements and applications towards an enterprise setup.
It consists of multiple pillars, which are building up the overall offering:

- **Vision:** Addresses the AI and data strategy of a company and a potential transformation roadmap to make AI a key
component of the company's offering.
- **Operating Model:** When the journey and the plan is fixed, it is essential to define the how to execute and operate
- **Data and Technology:** In order to scale AI applications and environments, it is also key to incorporate a strong management
and eco system for the existing data.
- **Engineering and Operations:** This addresses the questions of engineering, deploying and monitoring the AI solution. It is the
most technical part of the offering and is the focus of this playbook.
- **Change Management:** The process to transform and change existing AI structures is addressed in this pillar.
- **People and Enablement:** To achieve maturity and scalability in AI it is essential to also cover the right skill set,
roles and team setup in the AI organization.
